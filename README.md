# git-synchronizer

Git-synchronizer is an application meant to synchronize git repositories with eachother. It can synchronize the main repository with one or more mirror repositories.

Git-synchronizer fetches all branches and tags from the main repository and pushes them to the mirror repositories.

Git-synchronizer is optimized to work in a cron job. Main and mirror repoâ€™s are set using a config file. Git-synchronizer supports fetching and pushing multiple repositories at once.
